Hi, There is a good job for you to make an account in Etsy. And I will upload products on your store. If you have a desire, you can rent your store to me and receive 5% from each sale. I upload and sell my products.  Since I am from Russia and we have banned the registration of stores. If you have a desire, you can rent your store to me and receive 5% from each sale and that will be up to 3500$ per month. 
You just need to have an account in Etsy with connected bank account. Our co-work is long-term. 
I want you to create a new Etsy acc with a new gmail and connect your bank acc. Clients will deposit into your bank acc. If so all money will be controlled by you. You will be supposed to send 95% money except fee to me weekly via cryptocurrency. 

Your profit will be up to 3500 ~ 4000$ monthly. Our previous co-worker went away with week money but that is not a big one for our team and he won't gain any more. 

It is better to connect a bank account, because if you use Paypal, then you will have to track the order numbers on Paypal and there is still a long hold of money. You can use Paypal, but you will be doing extra work. We will receive the track number of orders, send it to you, and you will go to Paypal and upload the track number of the order in transactions for each order. If you use paypal, then you have to do it, if you use a bank account, then you don’t need to do anything. 


There was a listing stage in registration, you don’t need to post a bunch of goods there, we have photos and descriptions of our perfume, we do it, you put any trinket there for $ 10 and give it a name and description, this thing will not be sold !!!  This is only for registering the store, when I come in I will remove it from sales.
Example



Look, first you need to analyze the market and set the most profitable positions, and then our person from Eu will buy them within 3-6 days.


Then look, I'll be logged into the account soon, you first need to log out of it, otherwise if there is a double connection, Etsy may block


---- Bro, if you say you cheated me, i will not disappoint you cuz there maybe also my fault to believe. lol

But to me, the time is important. Sincerely are you really perfumes sellers?

To be honest, no, we are not deceiving you and not buyers, but the site, we receive money, you would really receive 10%, we would get 90%, and Etsy would return the entire cost of things to the buyer, so no one will be deceived, except for the site.

These are the cases, but we really used to sell perfumes

Until the closure of all sites in Russia

---- Then the perfumes are made from where? You are  not manufactures, are you?
And I didn’t say that we are manufacturers, these are photos of real perfumes, this is the Creed brand, Tom Ford, etc.
---- Then Creed brand company doesn't have store on Etsy?

They don't need a store on Etsy, it's like a firm, a company, they have their own store, just like there is no Nike, Adidass, Tesla store on Etsy, etc.
Creed, Tom Ford, Gucci, Versachi, D&G
These are big companies
They don't need Etsy, Amazon, Alibaba, Ebay
And the store was blocked, and the truth is due to your mistakes
This is not the first time we have done this and we know all the nuances
And before that they sold for real
I told everything in principle, but I repeat that not you, not people would not have been deceived
They would have returned all the funds, to the last pound, and you would have received your percentage
The only downside is the website.

We cannot change anything in the store, even if you change the name. We cannot change any data there.

Even if you wants to, you will be able to change the data, for example, of your one bank account to another, only if the second bank account belongs to the same name, surname, patronymic, in other words, to you.




======================

You do not need a person with an account and registration of that
To place an order, it is enough to enter the minimum dates, Gmail, password and address
Go to the Etsy website pls follow the link and enter the address and payment method, no need to specify anything else like before
