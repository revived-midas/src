I am asking for implementing new alert messages into Stochastic indicator. The present code just sends out general alert messages named: “Stochastic Crossing”.

New separated alert settings as following:

1. New Alert Message: “Stochastic Continuing” for
ArrowUpClr = Yellow;
ArrowDnClr = Magenta;

2. New Alert Message: “Stochastic Reversing” for
ArrowUpRevClr = DeepSkyBlue;
ArrowDnRevClr = LimeGreen;

Important conditions for No. 2: This alert message should be sent only, if the previous candle triggered an “Stochastic Crossing”! Only the prior candle! No “Stochastic Reversing” alert message if 2; 3 or more candles past already!
This alert should be possible to set “True” or “False” as external Input options.

Unchanged Alert Message: “Stochastic Crossing” for
ArrowInZoneUp = clrWhite;
ArrowInZoneDn = clrRed;

Likewise other external Input settings shouldn’t be changed. I use the 1 Minute Time Frame mainly.
Please check the screen shot attached!
