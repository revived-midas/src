Andrew, I think the interesting challenge will be to try and spot/filter out of our final results those wallets that belong to the following:
- Bots
- Owners of the respective tokens
- Exchanges with large holdings of the respective tokens
Ultimately we're trying to generate a list of the wallet addresses of a list of solid, highly profitable, independent and active DEX traders.

It requires more than scraping. The results need to be analyzed / cross-referenced to determine who are the most successful independent traders, who are trading across multiple tokens (not just a single token as that may suggest they are the token owner), to intelligently filter out wallet addresses associated with bots, token owners and exchanges.
