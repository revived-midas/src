Do NOT change user name, github name, location and etc.
You can just add repos and join new organization and accept invite.
In a nutshell, `add` is okay but `change` or `remove` is not allowed 'cause I am also currently using this github account for my work. Dont let my clients give me the axe.

And you definitely need to have your own github account. (its a must)
Create and grow it professionally.
It usually takes 6 months or more to make it awesome like mine.

Keep growing with patience.
