Hi, dear.

I hope you are well. 
I am so glad to apply for the job position at your company.

With over 9+ years of experience in full-stack & blockchain development, I am confident that I possess the technical skills and expertise necessary to excel in this role.
I am an effective communicator and thrive in collaborative environments. I am an enthusiastic learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in both web development and blockchain to ensure that I deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of clients.
I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and experience to your company and contribute to its growth and success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing further how I can add value to your team.

Best regards.
Thanks.
